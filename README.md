# Fractal Creator

Python library for creating and viewing geometric fractals.

# Howto

You need a base diagram definition, a recursion rule and an arrangement rule for
your fractal.

Base diagram will be a list of `Line`s. Recursion rule and arrangment rule will be
a list of `Transform`s.

The library will then apply the recursion rule for fixed number of recursions to
the base diagram and finally arrange the fractal using the arrangment rule.

# Features

 - Color changes in the transform to generate colorful fractals
 - SVG output (needs fine-tuning)
